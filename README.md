- 👋 Hi, I’m Harry, I'm a Software Developer and graduate from Makers! My past career was as a Primary Teacher and Year Group Leader.
- 👀 Retraining in Tech: I made the big decision to retrain! I'm happy to say that so far the analytical skills, love of learning and problem solving I honed in my teaching career are serving me well on my coding journey! 
- 🌱 My favourite languages are Python and Javascript, I'm a little bit in love with React and I'm starting to learn Typescript
- ⭐️ Fun Facts: I love cycling, playing with my baby boy and I'm addicted to chocolate digestives!
