- 👋 Hi, I’m Harry, I'm currently retraining as a Software Developer at Makers! My past career was spent educating London's children as a Primary Teacher and Year Group Leader.
  
- 👀 Retraining in Tech: I decided to retrain and so far the analytical skills, love of learning and problem solving I honed in my teaching career are serving me well on my coding journey! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Kotlin
- ⭐️ Fun Fact: I love cycling, playing with my baby boy and I'm addicted to chocolate digestives!
- 📫 Feel free to drop me a message or an email 😃
